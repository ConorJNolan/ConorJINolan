# 👋 Welcome to Conor Nolan's GitHub

## 🧠 About Me

I'm Conor Nolan — a data scientist, researcher, and developer with a Master’s in Computing & Information Science and a deep passion for building impactful solutions at the intersection of **healthcare**, **analytics**, and **immersive technologies**.

I specialize in **data analytics**, **machine learning**, **game telemetry**, and **VR-based rehabilitation tools**. I’m currently involved in ongoing projects with Mayo Clinic, extending my thesis research on **enhanced haptic assessment and wrist rehabilitation**, and contributing to the development of novel performance analytics in **Counter-Strike 2**.

## 🎓 Education

- 🎓 **M.S. in Computing and Information Science with a Focus in Machine Learning and A.I.** – University of North Florida  
  Thesis: *Enhanced Haptic Assessment: Advancing Hand Recovery Through Progressive UI/UX and Dynamic Force Implementation*

- 🎓 **B.S. in Information Science**

My graduate work bridged neuroscience, rehabilitation, and immersive UI design, aiming to develop real-time feedback systems for motor skill recovery. I continue to push this research forward through independent projects and collaborations. With the expectation to publish two additional papers.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

### 🩺 **Haptic Feedback & Rehabilitation Interfaces**
- Built in Unity with C# and Python analytics
- Uses real-time force data and participant-traced movement to evaluate wrist function recovery
- Outputs quantitative metrics (error angles, force profiles, precision curves)

### 🎮 **Counter-Strike 2 Performance Analytics**
- Full-stack pipeline to parse `.dem` files with [`awpy`](https://github.com/pnxenopoulos/awpy) and insert into a structured PostgreSQL schema
- Custom metrics developed:
  - 🧠 **Anti-Impact Score**  measures lost potential of a killed player
  - 🎯 **Crosshair Placement Score** angular error-based aim evaluation
  - 🕹️ **General professional analysis for the benefit of any team
- Supports Tableau visualizations, seasonal trend analysis, and JSON exports for frontend integration

### 🧪 **VR + Data Science Explorations**
- Concepts for using VR in cognitive assessment and recovery
- Exploratory projects merging XR and machine learning for real-world therapeutic outcomes


## 📈 Goals

- Contribute to the future of **AI-powered rehabilitation** and **data-driven healthcare**
- Secure a long-term role in healthcare analytics and immersive therapy systems – ideally at **Mayo Clinic’s Virtual Therapy division**
- Continue evolving my **CS2 analytics suite** into a scalable, web-based platform
